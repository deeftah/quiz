"Which trial showed that ticagrelor significantly reduced the rate of CV death, MI, or stroke without an increase in the rate of overall major bleeding when compared to clopidogrel?",PLATO,ASCEND,CHARISMA,WOEST,TRITON-TIMI 38,"The PLATO trial (2009) showed that compared to clopidogrel, ticagrelor significantly reduced the rate of CV death, MI, or stroke without an increase in the rate of overall major bleeding."
What did the COURAGE trial show?,"In patients with stable CAD, there were no differences in death and MI between optimal medical therapy plus PCI vs. OMT alone",Renal artery stenting does not improve renal or cardiac clinical outcomes in patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis.,"In patients with multivessel CAD undergoing revascularization, PCI is inferior to CABG.","Stenting and endarterectomy were associated with simliar rates of stroke, MI, and death.",In patients on oral anticoagulation alone (double therapy) was associated with a significant reduction in bleeding complications compared to patients receiving clopidogrel with aspirin (triple therapy).,"The COURAGE trial (2007) showed that in patients with stable CAD, there were no differences in death and MI between optimal medical therapy plus PCI vs. OMT alone."
What did the COMPASS trial show?,"In patients with established stable atherosclerotic disease, rivaroxaban plus aspirin resulted in a 1.3% absolute risk reduction in cardiovascular death, stroke, or nonfatal MI, with a trend toward improved mortality.","In patients with established stable atherosclerotic disease, apixaban plus aspirin resulted in a 1.3% absolute risk reduction in cardiovascular death, stroke, or nonfatal MI, with a trend toward improved mortality.",Clopidogrel reduces CV outcomes more than aspirin when used as secondary prevention among patients with prior stroke or MI.,"In patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and at ≥1 risk factor, apixaban is associated with a greater reduction in rates of stroke or systemic embolism while having a lower rate of lower bleeding than warfarin.","Among patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, rivaroxaban is noninferior to warfarin in preventing stroke and systemic thromboembolism.","The COMPASS trial (2017) showed that In patients with established stable atherosclerotic disease, rivaroxaban plus aspirin resulted in a modest 1.3% absolute risk reduction in cardiovascular death, stroke, or nonfatal MI, with a trend toward improved mortality. This benefit was offset by a 1.2% increased absolute risk in major bleeding."
